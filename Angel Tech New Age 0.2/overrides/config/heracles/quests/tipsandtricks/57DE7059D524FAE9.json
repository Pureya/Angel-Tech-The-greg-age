      "Simply put, Gregicality Multiblocks are larger versions of the GregTech machines you might be familiar with. The obvious increase in resource cost is worth your time, as they can be upgraded to gain the ability to process recipes in parallel - similar to the Processing Array multiblock you will encounter soon enough.",
      "{@pagebreak}",
      "They also introduce Machine Modes - depending on the configured machine mode, the Multiblock will use a different recipe type when processing materials. You can change this from the machine GUI by clicking on the Robot Arm button.",
      "{@pagebreak}",
      "By including Parallel Control Hatches in your Gregicality Multiblocks, you can grant them parallel processing capability. There are 4 tiers of hatch, each further increasing parallel capability by an factor of 4."
